## Introduction

This repository was submitted as the final project for CS50X 2023 online course offered by Harvard University. It’s a web application built around Flask’s framework and some software development/web programming languages covered by the course, such as Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML and CSS. The application is designed for storing passwords.

The central component of the application is the password vault, where the user can store, retrieve, upload and delete their credentials from other sites or apps, which encompass domains, usernames, and passwords. To enable these interactions, the main application is supported by additional files, that contain utilities and security functions.

Here's an overview of the interface:

The project files follow the layout guidelines of [Flask] (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/tutorial/layout/), but in a simplified manner. The root files are app.py, helpers.py, security.py and schema.sql, serving as the backend of the application. Regarding the frontend, it is divided into two folders: static and templates. These folders host user-interactive functionality scripts, a style sheet and svgs, and HTML content, respectively.
